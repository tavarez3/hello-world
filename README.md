Introduction to Me
Howdy! (I say howdy as a default greeting because I'm from Texas)
My name is Alyssa and thanks to school, social pressure, and geuine intrest I have joined github. I first realized I loved to code when I took my first programming language course (Java) and since then I've been hooked. I would love to find some kind of development job where I can spend all day coding. For now, I try to code inbetween work and classes, I'm hoping Github gives me that motivation to keep practicing!
